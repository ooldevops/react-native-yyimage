# react-native-yyimage
YYImage for React Native

This is react native port of [YYImage](https://github.com/ibireme/YYImage) library.

Hints you wanna know:
* use _Pods_ for [YYImage](https://github.com/ibireme/YYImage) dependency
* lib returns the image size on `onLoadEnd`
* port was written to match [FLAnimatedImage](https://github.com/nihgwu/react-native-flanimatedimage) implementation (it doesn't contain `onFrameChange` method ) 

## Install

**You have to install [YYImage](https://github.com/ibireme/YYImage) first** via _Pods_

```shell
npm install react-native-yyimage --save
